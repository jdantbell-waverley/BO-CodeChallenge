The People Locator App is a web application that allows you to add people and their coordinates, and then search for people within a certain range of kilometers from your own coordinates. This application is built using Node.js, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and TypeScript.

# Usage

The frontend of the People Locator App is built using React.js and Leaflet with react-leaflet to display a map with markers indicating the location of the users.

If you have installed the client and server correctly, the app should create the user myself which represents your own coordinates as a user, then you can just click on the "add user" button to add as many people as coordinates you want, finally in the field "search by km" enter a number in kilometer, if the added people are within the selected distance you can see which people are in the selected range.

You can also click on the added person in the list on the left bar and the map will automatically take you to the approximate area where the person is located.
